General Usage Notes
--------------------

Running on Node.JS 11.10.1

Function.txt contains code that can run in console. I used codepen for ease of use. Console parameter can be

`countcoins(100, [25,10,5,1])`

This would display the total number of ways to make change for 100cents. You can also input any other number to make change for. It essentially handles the second part of the problem which would be hitting a certain amount using a different variation coins.
